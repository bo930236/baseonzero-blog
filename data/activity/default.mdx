## Languages

MACHINE 🤖

- Python, Perl, R, PHP, Matlab/GNU Octave, bash/shell, some superficial knowledge of C, common LISP and Haskell; markup languages including LATEX/XƎTEX, R Markdown, HTML, CSS.

HUMAN 🗣

- English 🇺🇸 | Amharic 🇪🇹

## ❇️ Usual Workflow

- I use a vim-based setup in a tiling window manager (i3-gaps). I compile documents using R Markdown or LATEX, and biber for references. I prefer to do multimedia manipulation in the terminal with tools like imagemagick and ffmpeg for extensibility’s sake. I’ve run Microsoft, MacOS and GNU/Linux systems (both Debian and Arch-based varieties).

## 📈 Programs I’m Familiar With

- tmux, ssh, RStudio, Blender, Praat, Audacity, E-Prime, GIMP, pandoc, Jupyter. I’ve managed websites manually via ssh and vim using HTML/CSS/PHP and with tools such as Github Pages (Jekyll) WordPress via either cpanel or wp-cli
